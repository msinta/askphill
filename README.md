 # STOX Mobile Website Front-End Design ðŸš€

ðŸ”—  [Link to Website ](https://msinta.github.io/askphill/)

## Objective:
Recreate the mobile menu from STOX energy socks. The assignment is designed to assess your ability
to:
1. Follow a design to the pixel;
2. Style websites;
3. How you would model and manipulate simple data in React / Javascript.

The design file is supplied here(https://www.figma.com/file/yMto60axvQDtjwDIRMAxdF/STOX-Assignment-2022...), please recreate the design in a pixel-perfect manner. If you find instances where the design hinders your development, it is recommended to use your best judgement
to make the menu look as presentable as possible.

## Functionality:
1. When you click on hamburger it appears (see for reference). By default the page
should be empty.

2. Create image slider. Please do this in CSS.

3. When you click on an accordion item it shows the relevant sub-menu. You can be creative with
the items of the other categories.
